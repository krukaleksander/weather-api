# Weather Api

This api was made due a participation in El Passion workshop. Thank you for that experience!

- The application issues an endpoint `#GET / current_weather` which takes the parameters` lat`, `lon` and` alternateSource: boolean`.

- API in the above endpoint returns the current weather data for the given coordinates:

* temperature,
* pressure
* humidity,
* wind speed
* information about the data source used.

- Depending on the value of `alternateSource`, the application uses 2 different data sources. In case of false it is Weatherbit, if it's true - Visual Crossing Weather.

## Word about the tests

APIs that I use every hour or even more often return different values. So I couldn't run tests that examine these specific values, because each time I would have to check what api returns first. So I decided to check if the response object has properties, because if it has it means that the response is correct.
